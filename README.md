# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
This project was meant to be an analysis of ride data which had to be imported, transformed, and visualized using pandas and matplotlib. The data was imported from 2 large csv files and then aggregated to provide a bigger picture on driver information and fares. This information was transformed to help visualize it with a line chart to display information on 'Total Fare by City Type'.

## Results
Once the data was aggregated it became quite clear that most of the revenue is generated from rides in urban cities. Total fares showed urban cities accounted for $39854, while both suburban and rural combined amounted to $23684. Also, total rides showed that urban cities amount to a total of 1625 which is in great contrast to the 750 rides of both suburban and rural cities. 

Total drivers showed that urban cities has the most drivers, followed by suburban cities and lastly urban cities.

Average fare per ride showed that on average fares were most expensive in rural cities. Followed by suburban cities and lastly urban cities being the lowest. 

Rural cities did have the highest average fare per driver with a average of 55 per driver. This is in great contrast to suburban fares at 39.50 and urban cities at 16.57.

## Summary
### Recommendations

The data shows that drivers are lowest in rural cities and then followed by suburban cities. Availability is important for any ridesharing business and driver increase could have a positive effect on the number of total rides. This would help boost revenue. This could also be done by incentivizing drivers to take fares in suburban cities which does seem to bring in 30% of total fares but does seem to have a lack of drivers. Incentives could entice drivers from other areas to commute to suburban cities where the average fare per driver is substantially higher than the urban cities. Lastly, the average fare per ride is highest in rural areas. Possibly discounting fares in urban cities could help bolster total rides in those cites and ultimately help boost revenue.
